                <p class="paragraph">The Indian economy continues growing from strength to strength, and the standard of living in the country is also showing a marked improvement. The demographics of the country are changing as well - the 20-39 age group makes up a third of the country's population. A high percentage of this population is educated and hence open to exploring new ideas and products. So any business that is based on a novel concept would find a massive market in India waiting to be explored. As a result, India is becoming a popular destination for setting up a business or expanding an existing one. Some British entrepreneurs have identified this opportunity and have already set up shop in India or are planning to. And that decision should not raise any eyebrows. After all, who wouldn’t want to explore such an opportunity, especially at a time when the Indian government is providing all the support and facilities to foreign investors and entrepreneurs.
                <br> <br>
                If you are among those with no entrepreneurial ambitious, India still has a lot to offer you. India’s rapidly growing economy has spawned many jobs in the private sector. Some of these jobs, such as actuaries, for example, require specialisation. However, there is a lack of such professionals in India. The Indian banking and insurance industry, among many others, is more than willing to hire qualified British professionals in this field at a premium price. The situation is similar in other professions that require a high degree of specialisation. For Indian expats living in the UK, the newfound availability of highly remunerative jobs in India is just another reason to move back to their motherland. So if all these facts, and the abundance of professional and entrepreneurial opportunities make the idea of moving to India from UK seem very exciting to you, well, you are not alone! Lastly, the cost of living in India is also far less than that in the United Kingdom, which is another reason why you may want to consider hiring packers and movers from UK to India, such as yours truly, and move here.
                <br> <br>
                <strong>On a different note…</strong>
                <br><br>
                Just like some British citizens and Indian expats are lured by the idea of moving to India from UK, many Indian citizens dream of moving to the UK and living a settled life there. The UK is, after all, a culturally rich country which houses some of the best educational institutes in the world and one of the world’s top 5 economies. Its capital, London, is regarded as the world’s biggest and most important financial centre. For finance professionals, moving to London is nothing short of a dream. For automobile engineers and other professionals in the automobile industry, the UK is an attractive place to relocate to as it is a major automotive manufacturer. The UK’s booming aerospace industry ensures that the sentiments are similar for Indian professionals in this industry. Given the massive presence of Indian expats in most British cities, Indians moving to the UK would not feel too far away from home, which is yet another reason why the UK is a highly preferred relocation destination for Indians.

                    <p class="paragraph">Securing visas and work permits is one of the most time-consuming processes involved in an international relocation. British citizens need an e-TV (tourist visa) to enter India and an employment visa to work in the country. You can apply for an employment visa only if you have confirmed employment with an Indian company, or if you intend to do some voluntary work during your time here. You would be required to register with the Foreigners’ Regional Registration Office (FRRO) within 2 weeks of your arrival in India if you intend to stay in the country for more than 180 days.
